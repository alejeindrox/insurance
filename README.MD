## Resources

Insurance uses a number of open source projects to work properly:


### Server

* [Express](https://expressjs.com) - Is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) - A JavaScript library to connect with MongoDB.
* [Concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) - Run multiple commands concurrently.
* [Body-Parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) - Node.js body parsing middleware.
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io) - Compile Ecmascript code to Javascript code.
* [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io) - Simple monitor script for use during development of a node.js app.

Insurance uses the MongoDB service in the [MLAB](https://mlab.com) cloud to save and manage the database


### Client

* [React](https://reactjs.org) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) - React Components that Implement Google's Material Design.
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* [Moment](https://momentjs.com) - Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates in Javascript.
* [react-table](https://react-table.js.org) - A lightweight, fast and extendable datagrid built for React.

And of course Insurance itself is open source with a public repository on GitHub.
